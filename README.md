# Anna's ProPhone project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


To run this app you will need to visit [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/) and obtain an API key.

Create a `.env` file in the root directory. Add your API key there like this:
REACT_APP_API_KEY=your-key-here

From there you should be able to run this project! 

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


This was fun! Thanks for the challenge.
